Vuetify Pokemons
Description
Vuetify Pokemons is an interactive web application built with Vue.js framework and Vuetify library. The application allows users to explore the world of Pokemon through various features and integrations. It utilizes the PokeAPI to retrieve data about Pokemon on different pages.

Features
Home Page with Flip Card Feature: The home page utilizes the Vue Flip library to provide an interactive flip card feature. This feature presents users with basic information about a Pokemon and allows for dynamic flipping between the front and back sides of the card.

Pokemon Table: The Pokemon Table section fetches Pokemon data from the PokeAPI in a paginated manner. Users can sort the Pokemon table and view them in a Vuetify table component. Each row in the table can be expanded to display detailed information about a specific Pokemon.

Generations: The Generations section displays ApexCharts graphs for each Pokemon generation. These graphs provide visual representations of various statistics and attributes associated with each generation.

Statistics: The Statistics section showcases an ApexCharts donut chart comparing the number of Pokemon in each generation. This chart provides an overview of the distribution of Pokemon across different generations.

Dark Mode: The application supports dark mode, allowing users to switch between light and dark themes based on their preference.
